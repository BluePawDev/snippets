# Snippet Library

This snippet library is open source.

It was built specifically for use by developers of [Vanson Technology Services, Inc.](http://www.vansontech.com/) (*VTS*) and maintained by [Jason Ruby](https://github.com/BluePawDev).

This snippet library is a "living" repository in that it is to be continuously maintained and updated with examples of best practices and implementations as they pertain to the clients served by VTS.
