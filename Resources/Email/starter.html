<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- HTML5 DOCTYPE renders well and is the most current standard for HTML email. XHTML 1.0 Transitional, while previously the best option for HTML email rendering, is no longer best practices;  -->

<html lang="en">
<!-- Always set the lang attribute. Be sure to localize for audiances. Particularly important for assistative technologies/accessability. The lang is a global attribute therefore can be set on any HTML tag (e.g. the email may be in English with disclaimers/legal localized). -->

<head>

    <title></title>
    <!-- While not used in most email clients, research shows a lot of people triage their emails/inbox in a browser. Setting the <title> with the organization name, an abbreviated subject line inserted with a merge tage, or call to action is helpful as it will populate the browser tab as a reminder for users to come back to the "view in browser" email triage. Setting the <title> is also helpful for users who rely on screen readers for assistative technology. -->

    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
    <!-- Declaring the charset as utf-8 ensures proper rendering especially if using HTML character entities -->

    <!-- Ensures the email has the ability to be responsive. Do not disable zoom settings to override user's preferences. -->

    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <!-- A boilerplate setting to help make things more compatible for Microsoft products or any platform using IE/IE Edge.
    Assists with random buggy behavior typical to rendering in Microsoft products such as Outlook clients. -->

    <style type="text/css">
        /* Some CSS can be placed here although most should be inline to prevent being stripped out by email clients as many clients strip out the <head> as part of processing the email. */
    </style>

</head>

<body id="body" style="Margin: 0 !important; padding: 0 !important"></body>
<!-- Inline style to override margin and padding and zero out so email clients don't introduce extra space as some do by default.
    Additionally, capitalizing "Margin" can prevent Outlook clients from stripping out margin settings. -->
